	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Cantonese is usually written in Han characters (漢字). The written form does not provide informaiton as to how a character should be pronounced. For the purpose of language teaching and linguistic documentation, we need a way to accurately represent the sound of a word, and Jyutping fills the gap.\nJyutping is a standardised way to write out Cantonese sounds using only letters and numbers. Think of it as a way to spell Cantonese. It is easy to learn and systematic, making it an ideal tool in language teaching and information exchange.\n"
