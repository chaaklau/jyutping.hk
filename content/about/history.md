### Name
The name "Jyutping" (粵拼, "Cantonese romanization")
is a word compound formed by the first characters of _jyut6jyu5_
(粵語, "Cantonese") and _ping3jam1_ (拼音, "phonetic transcription"). The official name of the scheme is "The Linguistic Society of Hong Kong Cantonese Romanization Scheme", and it is sometimes referred to as LSHK Jyutping.

### Development
Jyutping was devised by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong in 1993, and was updated in 2018. It is currently maintained by the LSHK Jyutping Workgroup.
